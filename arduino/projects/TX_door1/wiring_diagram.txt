## Detailed Wiring

### Entry IR LED Circuit
```
3.3V ----[200Ω]---- IR LED Entry ---- D1
                    |
                    GND
```

### Exit IR LED Circuit
```
3.3V ----[200Ω]---- IR LED Exit ---- D2
                    |
                    GND
```

## LED Orientation
- **Entry IR LED**: Position to create beam for Door 1 entry sensor
- **Exit IR LED**: Position to create beam for Door 1 exit sensor
- **Distance**: 1-2 meters to corresponding receivers
- **Height**: 1-1.5 meters from ground for optimal coverage

## Power Requirements
- **Voltage**: 3.3V (regulated)
- **Current**: ~20mA per LED
- **Total Current**: ~40mA for both LEDs

## Network Function
- **WiFi Access Point**: Creates "ESP-Counter" network
- **Web Server**: Provides dashboard at device IP
- **API Endpoint**: Receives data from all sensors

## Notes
- Use current limiting resistors to protect LEDs
- Ensure proper LED orientation for beam creation
- Test beam alignment with IR receivers
- Monitor serial output for LED status and WiFi info
- LEDs remain continuously ON for reliable detection
- Access web dashboard at device IP address
