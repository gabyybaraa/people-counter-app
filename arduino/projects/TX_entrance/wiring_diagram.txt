# Wiring Diagram for TX_door1 - Dual TX Master Hub

## Component List
- NodeMCU ESP8266 (or compatible ESP8266 board)
- 2x IR333C LEDs (IR transmitters)
- 2x 200Ω Resistors (current limiting)
- Breadboard and jumper wires
- 3.3V power supply

## Pin Assignments
- **Door 1 Entry TX**: D1 (GPIO5)
- **Door 1 Exit TX**: D2 (GPIO4)
- **Power**: 3.3V
- **Ground**: GND

## Detailed Wiring

### Entry IR Transmitter (D1)
```
3.3V → 200Ω Resistor → IR333C LED → D1 (GPIO5)
GND → IR333C LED
```

### Exit IR Transmitter (D2)
```
3.3V → 200Ω Resistor → IR333C LED → D2 (GPIO4)
GND → IR333C LED
```

## Circuit Diagram
```
                    Entry TX (D1)
3.3V ──[200Ω]───[IR333C]─── D1 (GPIO5)
                    │
                   GND

                    Exit TX (D2)
3.3V ──[200Ω]───[IR333C]─── D2 (GPIO4)
                    │
                   GND
```

## Connection Details
- **Power Supply**: 3.3V from NodeMCU
- **Resistors**: 200Ω for current limiting
- **LEDs**: IR333C infrared LEDs for IR transmission
- **Output Mode**: Both pins configured as OUTPUT
- **Operation**: Continuously ON to create IR beams

## IR Beam Pairing
- **Entry TX (D1)**: Pairs with Door 1 Entry RX sensor
- **Exit TX (D2)**: Pairs with Door 1 Exit RX sensor
- **Distance**: 1-2 meters for reliable detection
- **Height**: 1-1.5 meters from ground

## Notes
- Both IR LEDs stay continuously ON
- 200Ω resistors limit current to safe levels
- D1 and D2 are both digital output pins
- GND connections are shared between both LEDs
- IR beams are invisible to human eye
- LEDs should be positioned to align with RX sensors
