```

## Detailed Wiring

### Entry Sensor Circuit
```
3.3V ----[200Ω]---- IR Receiver Entry ---- A0
                    |
                    GND
```

### Exit Sensor Circuit
```
3.3V ----[200Ω]---- IR Receiver Exit ---- D3
                    |
                    GND
```

## Sensor Orientation
- **Entry Sensor**: Position to detect people entering Door 1
- **Exit Sensor**: Position to detect people leaving Door 1
- **Distance**: 1-2 meters between sensors for reliable detection
- **Height**: 1-1.5 meters from ground for optimal detection

## Power Requirements
- **Voltage**: 3.3V (regulated)
- **Current**: ~50mA per sensor
- **Total Current**: ~100mA for both sensors

## Notes
- Ensure proper resistor values for voltage division
- Position sensors to avoid cross-interference
- Test sensor alignment with IR transmitters
- Monitor serial output for sensor readings
